# wagtools
Drop-in app providing streamfields, social links field, contact form, and sections.


Essentially an amalgamation of several existing projects such as :

- [Wagtail-Contact-App: Wagtail contact page app.] (https://github.com/chandra-kumala-school/Wagtail-Contact-App)
- [Wagtail-Social-App: Meta, Social Media and Facebook and Google Marketing code.] (https://github.com/chandra-kumala-school/Wagtail-Social-App)
- [Wagtail-Sections-App: Wagtail App that provides site sections and sub-pages.] (https://github.com/chandra-kumala-school/Wagtail-Sections-App)

This apps were updated to use the Streamfields system in Wagtail.
